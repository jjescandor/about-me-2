                <h2>Who Is She?</h2>
                <hr>
                <!--Put in detailed information about who you are as a person here-->
                <p>Hi! I'm Tiara Brown, an aspiring web developer who broke into the study of coding around July 2021. I
                    started
                    off my studies using a book called <em>Coding For Dummies</em> , but I've since moved on to online
                    resources and a coding bootcamp. My hopes is to become a kick-ass web developer within a year or
                    less if possible using a mix of
                    free and paid online resources and studying as hard as I possibly can.
                    <br>
                    I tend to spend my free time coding and following tutorials, then applying them to my own
                    project(s).

                <h2>Why is she leaving her previous field?</h2>
                <hr>
                <!--Explain the pros of starting a new career and how you felt held-back at your last job-->
                <p>The field of journalism is a tricky one to be in. The perks of it is that you get to interact with
                    humans on
                    a daily basis, for some that isn't a perk I know, that was really the highlight of the job for me.
                    But when
                    it boiled down to it, the company that I worked for wasn't really focused on making sure I grew as
                    an
                    individual. I felt bogged down with work and limited on the amount of times that I was assisted by
                    upper-management. I do not miss that part of the job, but helping others on a daily basis and
                    inspiring them
                    to reach for what they needed was the highlight of every single day that I clocked in. Now, I won't
                    say that
                    everyone that I worked with was a drag, there were some pretty helpful coworkers there that turned
                    into
                    life-long friends, but that wasn't enough to keep me there. <br> As a web developer I am able to
                    still be the creative person that I am and make a new impact on the world.

                <p>
                    Well as lame as this may sound, I like to spend my free time coding. It's fun, it keeps my brain
                    going, and helps me fill my day with meaningful actions.I also spend a great deal of time with my
                    dog because well he depends on me, haha and I love him! <img src="img/7G2A0612.jpg"
                        alt="A girl and her dog licking her nose"><br>
                    I also enjoy watching YouTube videos from Web Developers sharing their every day life in the job or
                    just tricks and tips to know.
